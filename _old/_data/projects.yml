  description:
      Maestro Workflow Conductor (MaestroWF) is a Python tool developed to provide a framework for specifying repeatable workflows. The core principles of its design aim to encourage workflows designed around consistency, repeatability, and self-documentation. Maestro accomplishes these principles via the processing of a  human-readable YAML specification called a "study specification" that describes the environment, workflow steps, and user parameters. The backend tool parses the specification, creates an execution plan, and executes the workflow automatically.

      While Maestro currently supports multi-stage workflows and automatic monitoring of execution, the wider goal is to develop Maestro as the building block that fits within a larger workflow system that supports modern GUI interfaces, large scale execution, and study campaign construction and tracking.
