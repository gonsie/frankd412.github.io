<!-- Something I've been thinking about for a while now (and something that most people who know me don't know I'm passionate about) is inclusive culture and fostering a culture where everyone can do their best work. Recently, I found myself filling out a culture survey with a variety of questions. Everything from rate this and that statement from strongly disagree to strongly agree to how much do you think such and such affects things like promotions, compensation, and etc. type questions.

While Adam presents material geared towards a marketing audience, the key takeaway is the same no matter the context: "[we] just want want to be treated like intelligent people who are are worthy of respect." That's true whether you're talking about marketing, interacting as peers, or as a supervisor to an employee. So now





<!-- According to Sinek, Millennials are being put into corporate environments that don't properly support us. While I agree with the overall statement, he breaks down the unhappiness of millennials into four parts:

1. Patience
2. Bad Parenting
3. Technology
4. Last
