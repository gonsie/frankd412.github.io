about:
    Reusability, modular and abstracted, flexible and robust – these qualities are the things that I am most passionate about as a Software Engineer and system designer. There is nothing better than delivering what the user needs and wants while also developing a system that not only outshines their expectations but that can be integrated seamlessly into other projects. It is my personal philosophy that we should always strive to exceed our limits; so much so, that I subscribe to the personal motto that “if it’s not broken, break it and make it better.”
